# AMRTD
An Antimicrobial Resistance-themed Tower Defense video game.


Based on the amazing Unity tutorial ["How to make a Tower Defense Game" by Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0), which we strongly recommend.

## Motivation of the project
This game is being developed as part of a worldwide effort to combat AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR) - in a word, the fact that antibiotics are less and less efficient in killing off harmful bacteria.

In particular, this game intends to raise awareness on the issue of AMR by demonstrating how it arises: through a misuse of antibiotics, be it overuse or underuse. This awareness objective is in line with the first objective of the [Global Action Plan on AMR](https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/en/) of the World Health Organization.

This project is under active development.

## Technical aspects

### Game Engine
Currently Unity 2019.3.0b8. The Unity version changed along the commits.

### Programming language
C#

### Graphical Assets
The current graphical assets are used as placeholders and tests and are therefore free sprites and 3d models from the internet. They were downloaded from free png websites - [pngimg](http://pngimg.com/), [imgpng](https://imgpng.ru), [hiclipart](https://www.hiclipart.com/) - and [Turbosquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/) and [Clara.io](https://clara.io/), which provide free and paid 3d models. These models were then edited through Clara.io.
